Thank you to those who attended and/or signed up,
Team:
We were really happy with the numbers. It's unfortunate how many issues popped up during setup. Also, from our side, some sections definitely could've been shortened.

The live coding sections overran terribly - sorry about that!
A corrected, completed LangGraph notebook should be in this repo
The issue in the upgraded chatbot was a name mismatch between the agent function and node definitions - very annoying
Exercises were left for you to do - you don't have to do them to get a certificate but they are pretty simple and reuse what you'd have learned during those sessions - I encourage everyone to at least have a go.
