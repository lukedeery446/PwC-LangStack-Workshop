Thank you to those who attended and/or signed up,
Team:
We were really happy with the numbers. It's unfortunate how many issues popped up during setup. Also, from our side, some sections definitely could've been shortened.

## Kevin (LangGraph)
- The live coding sections overran terribly - sorry about that!
- **A corrected, completed LangGraph notebook** should be in this repo "LangGraph_Student_Version.ipynb" has been updated
- The issue in the upgraded chatbot was a name mismatch between the agent function and node definitions - very annoying
- **Exercises were left for you to do** - you don't have to do them to get a certificate but they are pretty simple and reuse what you'd have learned during those sessions - I encourage everyone to at least have a go.

## If you want FREE LLM API ACCESS
- Look for Google's gemini-2.5-flash model
- You might have to create an account on their LLM API website and create your API key
- It will be there somewhere but Google doesn't like to promote it easily
- Ask ChatGPT on how to get it
- You will have to redefine some of the imports so:
  `"from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI" and
  "llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-2.5-flash")"`
- Drawback is that this model is a little weaker and might fail on some of the more complex tasks, suprisngly good in my experience though (for being free)
